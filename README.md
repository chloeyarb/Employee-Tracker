# Employee-Tracker


## Description 

This weeks challenge takes a deep dive into SQL by creating an employee tracker application that will allow the user to manage a company's employee database. This is a commandline 
application that uses Node.js. From the terminal, the user can run 'node index.js' and will be presented with a series of options to main the employee database. After choosing the option
the user will proceed to fill in the necessary information to add, update, or view the data. To achieve a functioning application the developer created a 'tracker' database which 
houses the tables and data used; this can be found in the DB folder on the Schema.sql and Seeds.sql files. The queries also include LEFT JOIN statements to enhance the information within the 
requested table. The developer used a constructor function which contains the functions to perform the different SQL queries. This challenge has been rewarding to be able to see the
many ways a database can be accessed. 

## Installation

This requires the NPM installation, which will produce the node_module folder. This will allows access to Inquirer, MySQL2 to connect to the database, and Console Table to print rows in the console. 

Please note a .gitignore was used for this project.
